# ftDuino case designs

These are mesh files for the ftDuino 1.1 case. At least bottom.stl and
top.stl are needed. Optionally bottom_with_bottom_mounts.stl can be
used instead of bottom.stl but that version is more difficult to print.

The reset.stl reset button is required if a 4.3mm tactile switch is
used as a reset button. It's not needed if a 7 or 9mm version is used.
