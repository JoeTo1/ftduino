# ftDuino case designs

These are mesh files for the ftDuino 1.1 case. At least ```bottom.stl``` and
one of ```top_with_isp.stl``` or ```top_without_isp.stl``` are needed.

The ```top_with_isp.stl``` is to be used if the ISP connector is to
be mounted. The ```top_without_isp.stl``` is for boards without ISP
connector. The ISP connector hole in ```top_with_isp.stl``` can alternally
be closed with the ```isp_cap.stl```.

The ```i2c_protector.stl``` is a small piece that fits onto the 6 pin
IÂ²C connector if it's not in use and prevents it from accidetially
being shortened or otherwise damaged.

The ```reset_button.stl``` reset button is required if a 4.3mm tactile
switch is used as a reset button. It's not needed if a 7 or 9mm
version is used.
