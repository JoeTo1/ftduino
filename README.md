# ftDuino

The ftDuino is an [arduino](http://arduino.cc) compatible controller for the
[fischertechnik construction toy](http://fischertechnik.de).

The latest version of the german manual can be found [here](https://github.com/harbaum/ftduino/raw/master/manual.pdf).

The ftDuino is similar to the fischertechnik TXT in size and shape as
well as electrically and can usually be used as a drop-in-replacement
to this controller.

The ftDuino combines the sophisticated mechanics of the fischertechnik
toy with the versatility of the arduino world allowing anyone to create
and program awsome machines.

## Features of the ftDuino

   - 8 universal analog inputs I1 to I8
   - 4 fast counter inputs C1 to C4
   - 8 analog outputs O1 to O8 which can be combined as motor outputs M1 to M4
   - IÂ²C connector like the fischertechnik TX controller  
   - compatible to standard fischertechnik 9V power supply
   - compatible with Arduino Leonardo

## About this repository

This repository contains support files to enable ftDuino support in
the Arduino IDE.

## Installation

You can easily add custom board support packages to the Arduino IDE
as described e.g. [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/overview).

You first need to add the download location of the ftDuino setup to
the preferences of the Arduino IDE:

Afterwards the ftDuino will show up in the board manager from where
it can be installed by just one click:

Afterwards the ftDuino can be selected as the current device and
e.g. the ftDuino code examples will automatically show up in the
file menu:

The ftDuino is now supported by the Arduino IDE and can be used
without any further setup.
